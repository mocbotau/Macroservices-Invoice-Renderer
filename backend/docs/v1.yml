        Given a UBL XML file, renders into a human readable visualisation in PDF form.
          There are 5 styles to choose from which are currently implemented.
          * Style ID 0 - Default: blue themed title headings for aesthetic appeal, and a moderate level of detail
          * Style ID 1 - Landscape: black and white landscape invoice with moderate detail for users who find the default layout too horizontally cramped
          * Style ID 2 - Detailed: as with Landscape style, but with greater detail for accountants and other professionals to visualise relevant data
          * Style ID 3 - Summary: black and white portrait invoice with minimal detail for shorter files and quicker understanding of invoice items
          * Style ID 4 - Default High Contrast: black and white version of Default style for vision impaired users (or those with only black and white printing)
